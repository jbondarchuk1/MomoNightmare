# Simple-Tools
Custom tools for Unity3D, repackaged from the development of my game The Wall

All tools revolve around ScriptableObject assets for a streamlined workflow. Classes outside of the SimpleTools namespace can access those ScriptableObject assets to easily manage project/realtime data.

Tools Included:

GameObject Painting / Erasing

GameObject Grounder

Asset Creator

Development Tracker

Asset Creator
